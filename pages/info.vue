          Washer / Dryer Projects was previously a gallery in <a href="https://mitchellbarton.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            class="underline lg:hover:text-blue">Mitchell Barton’s</a> laundry room and currently a gallery in his furnace room in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. The
          gallery functions as an unconventional space where artists can experiment in an abnormal/less-than-ideal art
          context. We don’t have openings or events — the space is committed to being mostly private and inaccessible in
          a
          physical sense, but all work can be viewed on this website.
          <br><br>
          The gallery is sometimes open when the laundry room is being used to do laundry.
          <br><br>
          Shows in the gallery are up for 4-5 weeks typically. Either that or as long as we feel like having them there.
